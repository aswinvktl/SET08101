Web Technologies Repository

There are three branches

1. Master - The main branch where there is stable code all the time, can be used somewhat like a backup.
2. experiments - As the name suggests, this is the branch where i try out stuff and this could well and truly anything that comes to mind.
3. labs - This is the branch where I will have html files and similar files to try out what is taught at the labs.
