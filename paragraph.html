        ("Inserting random paragraph here")

        The interpretation that has to do with this is interesting.
        The people we meet decide to continue mingling with us because of how we were to them when we met them.
        Like, all the things we talked about, the way we behaved, and the ideas we shared,
        should've been interesting that they thought they should continue meeting us.
        YES, external factors do matter when it comes to talking, like a common shared place,
        such as a house, school or workplace. However, you could be ignored there as well.
        But that common space forces you to interact.

        The paradox of relationships is quite interesting.

        You can either be loved, or be yourself.
        Can you be both??

        It is really funny and interesting to see that, I rarely see than in people. 
        In romantic relationships, this is very necessary, I believe. 
        Ever since we were kids, we have been told to be a “good kid”, so that we will be accepted for what we operate, rather than what we are authentically. 

        If the environment doesn't support our gut feelings and emotions, then to belong there, or to FIT IN,
        we constantly supress our emotions and connection to ourselves, for the sake of staying LOVED, 
        without which we cannot survive.  A lot of us are in this dilemma. 
        Yes, we did do a lot in life, but the troubled teenager is sat in there, making all these decisions.
